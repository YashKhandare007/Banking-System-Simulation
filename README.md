# Banking-System-Simulation
Creating a Banking System Simulation project in Java is a great way to showcase your knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA). Below, I explain how to design, implement, and run a basic banking system.
*Simulate a banking system with the following features:
1. Account Management: Create, delete, and view accounts.
2. Transactions: Deposit, withdraw, and transfer funds.
3. Transaction History: View all past transactions for an account.
4. Data Management: Store accounts and transactions in memory using DSA (HashMaps, Lists, etc).
